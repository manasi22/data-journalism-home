<b><font color='blue'><h1>Mango Men: How India's youngest political party is funding its journey</b></font color></h1>
<p>In the summer of 2011, a few months after the world was captivated by the images of the Arab Spring; a silent <a href = 'http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/world/asia/19hazare.html?ref=annahazare'> revolution </a href> against corruption was started on the streets of the Indian capital, one that spoke to general public right down to the lowest common denominator. The momentum gained by this anti-corruption movement was translated into the birth of the <a href= 'http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/'>Aam Aadmi Party(AAP)</a href>, which literally translates as the Common Man party. It broke into the Indian political scene, in late 2012, and was the quintessential underdog in ensuing state elections a year later. In one of the most surprising upsets in recent history, they managed to win get the second largest number of seats in the state constituency and went on to form a government with the external support of the very party they upstaged. </p>

<p> One of the most remarkable features of this organization, however, is that it sought donations on a public platform and went on to publish them on their website, something that was hitherto unheard of in the corruption-laden Indian political system. The donations which range from Rs.1 to Rs.5,00,000 (approximately $8000) have poured in from 94 countries since 2012 and present a fascinating data set while directly representing the party's rise and intermittent falls in popularity. </p>

<p>I was hoping to derive some information from the data and link it to the party's activities over a span of a year or even less. The specific questions I wanted to answer include,</p>
<p> 1) How current events impact donations: Specific events that I would want to link to trends in funding that include; winning the state elections (December 10th), the chief minister taking oath and forming a government (December 28th), offering free subsidies for water to consumers (December 30th), being embroiled in a controversy(January 29th) and finally resigning (February 15th), all of which they did in a span of less than two months. There have been conflicting news reports about the party's popularity after the chief minister, the head of state, resigned. The donation flow could be one of the indicators to quantify their popularity. </p>
<p> 2)Another interesting question I want to answer is where if the donations of highest values are from India itself or from international donors and if there is a pattern to those in both cases where there are hotspots with a higher number of people believe in the party and donate to the cause. The AAP website has stated that only Indian citizens who live in the country or abroad can donate to the party, which raises the question if there are a large number of Indians who are willing to donate money from smaller countries like Bahamas.  </p>
<p>The list of donations can be accessed from their <a href= 'http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/donation-list'> official website </a href>. Even though, we scraped the data using Ruby in last class, I want to learn the basic code, so the latest data can be accessed. Another thing I want to do in the future is making the data real time, so that the graphics can change according to data.  </p>

<p>I would like to speak to a <a href= 'http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/official-spokespersons'> media representative </a href> from the Aam Aadmi Party and a political analyst from the University of Chicago like <a href= 'http://home.uchicago.edu/~hussin/home'>Iza Hussain </a href> or <a href= 'http://home.uchicago.edu/~slater/'>Dan Slater </a href>, who specialize in Southeast Asian politics. This piece would be suitable for a mainstream newspaper like <a href= 'http://www.thehindu.com/'> The Hindu </a href> or <a href=' timesofindia.indiatimes.com'> Times of India </a href> or even US based mainstream publications, since around April the Indian general elections, which generally receive a lot of press, will take place.</p>

<p> (@K&A:The title Mango Men refers to the translation of party name, which also actually means Mango man (Aam=Mango)The broom is the party symbol for AAP used to signify a cleanse of the corrupt system.: I tried adding the caption to this image, but it just wouldn't align to the right. Hope you understand) </p>
