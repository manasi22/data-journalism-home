<b>How India's youngest political party is funding its journey</b>
<p>In the summer of 2011, a few months after the world was captivated by the images of the Arab Spring; a silent <a href = 'http://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/19/world/asia/19hazare.html?ref=annahazare'> revolution </a href> against corruption was started on the streets of the Indian capital, one that spoke to general public right down to the lowest common denominator. The momentum gained by this anti-corruption movement was translated into the birth of the <a href= 'http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/'>Aam Aadmi Party(AAP)</a href>, which literally translates as the Common Man party. It broke into the Indian political scene, in late 2012, and was the quintessential underdog in ensuing state elections a year later. In one of the most surprising upsets in recent history, they managed to win get the second largest number of seats in the state constituency and went on to form a government with the external support of the very party they upstaged. </p>
<p> One of the most remarkable features of this organization, however, is that it sought donations on a public platform and went on to publish them on their website, something that was hitherto unheard of in the corruption-laden Indian political system. The donations which range from Rs.1 to Rs.5,00,000 (approximately $8000) have poured in from 94 countries since 2012 and present a fascinating data set while directly representing the party's rise and intermittent falls in popularity. </p>
<p>I was hoping to, maybe derive some information from the data and link it to the party's activities: winning the elections, forming a government, passing legislative bills, and finally resigning, all of which they did in a span of less than two months.  There have been conflicting news reports about the partyâ€™s popularity after the chief minister; the head of state, resigned. The donation flow could be one of the indicators to quantify their popularity. Another interesting question I want to answer is where if the donations of highest values are from India itself or from international donors and if there is a pattern to those in both cases where there are hotspots with a higher  number of people believe in the party and donate to the cause. </p>
<p>The list of donations can be accessed from their <a href= 'http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/donation-list'> official website </a href>. I would need to learn how to scrape the data using Ruby from the website and make interactive graphics; in order to incorporate the news component into the data. </p>
<p>I would like to speak to a <a href= 'http://www.aamaadmiparty.org/official-spokespersons'> media representative </a href> from the Aam Aadmi Party and a political analyst from the University of Chicago like <a href= 'http://home.uchicago.edu/~hussin/home'>Iza Hussain </a href> or <a href= 'http://home.uchicago.edu/~slater/'>Dan Slater </a href>, who specialize in Southeast Asian politics. This piece would be suitable for a mainstream newspaper like <a href= 'http://www.thehindu.com/'> The Hindu </a href> or <a href=' timesofindia.indiatimes.com'> Times of India </a href> or even US based mainstream publications, around April when the Indian general elections, which generally receive a lot of press, will take place.</p>



<b>How do US kids fare in STEM education ?</b>
<p>Are today's 9th graders smarter than those a decade ago? How big an influence is race and ethnicity in a teenager's STEM education? How do students from US fare, when their understanding of science and math is compared to those from China, Japan or Europe? These and many other important questions can be answered by taking a look at the <a href ='http://www.nsf.gov/statistics/seind14/content/chapter-1/c01.pdf'>Science and Engineering Indicators </a href> released by the National Science Foundation.</p>
<p>The data is split by different categories such as ethnicity, race, parent's education and sex, all of which are important indicators to the economic and social standing of the student. These could then be used to study the effect of these indicators on STEM education of 9th graders.  Another much talked about issue is the access to resources for advanced study of math and science. I would like to see if it is possible to link this to the type of school and the economic background of the students, by using the given data. While the number of students graduating on time has increased every year, the figures are dichotomous when it comes segregated according to race. This information can be presented in a powerful manner through an infographic. </p> 
<p>Ideally, I'd like to speak to an official from the US Department of Education  to get their perspective on these supposed trends and highlight other factors that might influence a student's performance in these areas. This feature would be suitable for a publication like Scientific American or Slate.</p>

<b> Which states are the unhealthiest? </b>
<p> A lot has been written about the obesity epidemic in the States since the last decade. A number of interventions have been introduced into schools to stem childhood obesity like the ban on <a href= 'http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/opinion/an-overdue-ban-on-trans-fats.html'>trans fats </a href> and <a href= 'http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/04/health/04soda.html?_r=0 '> sweetened drinks </a href> in certain parts of the country. A fascinating correlation can be seen between the states where children score higher on behavioral indicators like <a href= http://www.cdc.gov/physicalactivity/downloads/PA_State_Indicator_Report_2010.pdf'>watching TV </a href> and drinking cola and reduced physical activity with the fact if the state had existing legislation to restrict access of fat inducing substances.</p>

<p>For example, Rhode Island has banned the sale of soda drinks in schools and the students from that state were found to drink less soda overall, as compared to other states. These indicators can then be used to determine the scale of influence state legislature has had on the levels of obesity in each state. The data has been collected by the Center of Disease Control. I would need to learn some visualization techniques to incorporate more than one parameter of information into a map of the country with each state being scored on the percentage of obese children and segregated if they have any specific legislature against obesity.</p>

<p>Such an article would be ideal for Scientific American or a blog on ProPublica.
